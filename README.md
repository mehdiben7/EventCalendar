# EventCalendar

## About

This is the final project I've worked on for my 420-201-RE (Introduction to Programming) course at Vanier College in Montreal, QC, Canada. We were asked to create a small calendar app that could manage events.

### Trivia

I got 93 and 35 [R-score](https://www.bci-qc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03-R_Score_what-it-is_what-it-does_BCI-july12-2017.pdf "learn more about the R-score") grade for this course

## Going further

I plan on implementing this project into an Android/an IOS (SwiftUI) app
